## Notes / action items / misc talk

Launch statistics 24 hours after the announcement (thanks for collecting this, Robert)
  * Overall, we’ve gotten very positive reactions and support Our [launch tweet](https://twitter.com/OpenWebDocs/status/1353748877111918593) has so far had 318,698 impressions, the [launch blog post](https://opencollective.com/open-web-docs/updates/introducing-open-web-docs) has had 25,000 views, we’ve reached [75 contributors on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/open-web-docs), our [Twitter account @OpenWebDocs](https://twitter.com/OpenWebDocs) has reached 1,025 followers and we now have over [176 stars on GitHub](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project).
  * We also spent a long time being the #1 news on Hacker News: [https://news.ycombinator.com/](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
  * The story was picked up on over 20 international press sites.

Interacting with backers notes (item 4)
  * Would it make sense to invite them to the OWD slack?
  * Lola - seems like a good idea to have the discussions all in one place
  * Adrian — what numbers are we looking at here? 10, 10,000?
  * Florian - GH repo has 20 watchers, they would be interested
  * Slack also less technical than GH
  * Brian - some people don’t like slack either
  * Robert - also some people have far too many slacks
  * Also great opportunity with GH for inviting people, turning them into active contributors, helps their metrics.
  * Dom - let’s take a more solid approach with this
    * Clear strategy
    * Good social media strategy takes time
  * Florian - agreed, also need to think about what their donation gets them
  * GH/org membership, warm fuzzy feeling?
  * Kyle - we already got a few questions like this. Would be good to enumerate these questions, think about where it would be good to direct them too - e.g. Slack/GitHub would have different purposes
  * Dom — we already have lots of community places (slack, twitter, github, newsletter) - so even making sense of them would be useful. So maybe a Get-involved.md place?
  * Florian — anyone volunteering?
  * Jory raises hand.
  * ACTION — Jory to write proposal for this

Hosting a live Q&A on Wed, February 17 at around noon EST (point 5)
  * Lola — is this open to everyone?
  * Florian — yes. Probably using the W3C zoom.
  * Duration — 1 hour
  * Lola — also live stream zoom? In case some people can’t run it
  * Brian — it works on the web
  * Lola — Livestream to YouTube was good
  * Chris — what about text chat?
  * Dom/others — could use zoom chat, YT comments, or maybe reddit AMA?
  * Robert — beforehand, let’s collect questions so we are prepped
  * Dom/Kyle — Can we record and post the Zoom call with transcripts (and then commit to following up in e.g. Slack if folks have questions)? That could help with broader accessibility

OWD planning
  * OWD prioritization criteria
  * Brian — timing, what does that mean?
  * Chris - do we document stuff that is on the curve of getting interesting, or have we missed it by months (or years?)
  * Florian — similar
  * Brian - we definitely need to say something a bit more concrete here, make sure we agree with it.
  * ACTION: Folks present give feedback on prioritization criteria, what is the best way to word these? Hard to give exact answer, but also being realistic about uncertainty is good

Metrics
  * Florian and Robert met to discuss metrics and tracking
  * See [https://docs.google.com/document/d/15_PrpIfYuP1WmevEFSvERbb1NLOSUrMmG5YTGf3Qj3s/](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15_PrpIfYuP1WmevEFSvERbb1NLOSUrMmG5YTGf3Qj3s/?authuser=1)
  * ACTION all: Please give feedback!
