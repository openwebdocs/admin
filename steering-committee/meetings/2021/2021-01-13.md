## Agenda

1. Please sign the [Membership Expectation document](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/blob/main/steering-committee/membership-expectations.md) 
if you haven’t already. 
1. Need to define member alternates
1. MDN Content Update
    - [MDN Editorial Meeting updates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ANeo9ZlQMLPrX_4xsQXkItEnXCAOJYoVQQrZqLQEKlI/edit#heading=h.z74cfgrb0siz)
    - Florian presented two issues / food for thoughts:
      - [MDN API docs: (simple) inheritance structures](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/1006)
      - [Spec sections should be sourced from BCD](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/1146)
    - Florian documented [`enterkeyhint`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/enterkeyhint). 
     It was an interesting exercise as it involved contributing to: mdn/browser-compat-data, mdn/interactive-examples, and mdn/content.
    - KumaScript macros are in the way if we convert from HTML to markdown (or to something else). 
    Florian tries to see what the [process to remove a macro is these days](https://github.com/mdn/yari/pull/2506).
1. BCD update
    - BCD signals are [shut down](https://github.com/mdn/kuma/issues/7721#issuecomment-757452921) (feedback mechanism for BCD). Will use GitHub issues for feedback instead. 
    Florian reviewed [Daniel’s GitHub-Action](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/8703) that helps us close invalid issues.
1. OWD 2021 planning
    - RESOLVED: [High level goals for 2021](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/blob/main/2021-goals.md) published
    - [First MDN content opportunity assessment meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CMQiXVRInksCnRjkDJlVKW56dqaj3cXv37tUf0Zw9wo/edit#) happened
    - [Some OWD project ideas for MDN](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a2LXI1zNCrdHQp5OYcg1HLCt2sjzmtWhT62S-jLFXfk/edit#heading=h.9ambpag4zg5m) were voted on and discussed
