# OWD prioritization criteria
The [OWD charter](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/blob/main/charter.md) says _"prioritize based on the needs of the global community of web developers and designers"_. This document describes criteria for open and sponsor/vendor-neutral prioritization and will further guide OWDâ€™s decision-making.

## Criteria
In no particular order. When deciding about what to prioritize and which opportunity to work on, OWD will take into account:

* [Effort](#Effort)
* [Dependencies](#Dependencies)
* [Community enablement](#Community-enablement)
* [Momentum](#Momentum)
* [Enabling learners](#Enabling-learners)
* [Enabling professionals](#Enabling-professionals)
* [Underrepresented topics / ethical web](#Underrepresented-topics--ethical-web)
* [Operational necessities](#Operational-necessities)
* [Addressing needs of the Web industry](#Addressing-needs-of-the-Web-industry)

### Effort
* A higher cost ranks negatively
* How much time needs to be spent?
* How many pages to write?
* How complex is the problem?
* If new pages, how much maintenance will the pages require over time (e.g. how much in flux is the relevant technology space)?

### Dependencies
* More dependencies rank negatively
* Does it need a change in the platform?
* Does it need involvement from external people? (spec authors, spec tooling, etc.)

### Community enablement
* More enablement ranks positively
* Is the work shareable?
* Does the opportunity allow more contributors to join the project?
* Does the opportunity allow contributors to be more effective?

### Momentum
* More momentum ranks positively
* Are there enough implementations for a technology (and/or implementation interest)?
* Is there a lot of community interest?
* Has the specification stabilized? Is there no longer a risk that APIs will be renamed, redesigned etc.?

### Enabling learners
* Higher enablement ranks positively
* Is the opportunity about concepts that need to be learned in order to understand the Web better? (as opposed to just another API reference, or some such thing)
* Does the opportunity contribute an educational pathway for someone to understand a key web development-related topic?

### Enabling professionals
* Higher enablement ranks positively
* MDN is known for being a reliable source of information for professionals. 
* Does the opportunity address needs of professional web developers and industry experts?
* Does the opportunity close a gap to the competition? (other platforms, native developers, proprietary tech)

### Underrepresented topics / ethical web
* Higher under-representation ranks positively
* Is the opportunity in the realm of accessibility, privacy, performance (on low-end devices), or other aspects of an ethical web?
* Does the opportunity address the needs of an underrepresented market or geographical area?

### Operational necessities
* Higher ranking if the opportunity is identified as an absolute must-know  
* Example: All browsers unship AppCache. It is absolutely necessary for web developers to learn how to cache using Service Workers
* Example: High severity security issues web developers need to be aware of

### Addressing needs of the Web industry
* Higher ranking if opportunity speaks to needs of the web industry
* Does the opportunity address (or work towards easing) pain points mentioned in the MDN DNA and other important surveys/data points?
* Is the opportunity mappable to data from surveys like State of CSS/JS etc.?
* Is there evidence in data from sources like caniuse or MDN that people look for help on a particular topic?

## Weighting
The above criteria are in no particular order. However, depending on the opportunity, certain criteria might be more important than others. For example, being data-driven is important, so if there is indication that an opportunity addresses a previously identified web developer pain point then that could mean a lot.

To that extent, the following criteria are usually weighted twice as much as others:
* [Effort](#Effort)
* [Operational necessities](#Operational-necessities)
* [Addressing needs of the Web industry](#Addressing-needs-of-the-Web-industry)
