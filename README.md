# Open Web Docs project

## About
[Open Web Docs](http://openwebdocs.or«µ) supports web platform documentation for the benefit of web developers & designers worldwide. We are a community of web developers, standards makers, and technology companies that rely on this documentation as critical digital infrastructure, and we work cooperatively to ensure its long-term success and maintenance. 
See our [charter](charter.md).

## Governance

We are comprised of:
* A **Governing Committee** which administers the financial sponsorships made via opencollective.com, and explores strategic partnerships and needs for web documentation projects. Governing Committee members are representatives of organizations that have made substantial financial contributions to OWD, and include one representative from staff.
* A **Steering Committee** which develops and implements shared public roadmaps for key documentation priorities, and facilitates community involvement and execution of those priorities. Steering Committee members are invited on the basis of their expertise and perspective, and represent a mix of individual developers, standards developing organizations, non-sponsoring organizations, and other key stakeholders.
* **Full-time technical writing staff** who oversee and execute on day-to-day documentation tasks, lead steering committee conversations, and develop and measure success. Staff are legally-compliant employees of the project. 
* **Community contributors**, including technical writers from other organizations, web designers and developers, standards authors, and other individuals interested in contributing high-quality content for documentation, feedback, proposals or other input. Anyone can be a community contributor.

All participants are expected to abide by the [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md) and follow our membership expectations guidelines.
