# Open Web Docs Charter

## Mission

Open Web Docs supports web platform documentation for the benefit of web developers & designers worldwide.


## Core Values

Open Web Docs believes open web platform documentation is critical digital infrastructure that benefits everyone. To demonstrate that belief, we:

- _focus_ on documentation that has a positive impact on end users and web developers.
- _prioritize_ based on the needs of the global community of web developers and designers.
- _maintain_ an independent editorial voice, with a “firewall” between fiscal and editorial matters. 
- _adhere_ to open source principles of transparency in project governance, investment, and feature development in order to maintain trustworthiness and credibility with the web community. 
- _work_ to make the platform more equitable, investing in documenting internationalization, accessibility, and privacy components of the web.
- _emphasize_ diversity and inclusion across all our efforts including project contributions, community organization, and resource allocation.

## What We Do
To execute our mission and values, we contribute to MDN Web Docs and other related efforts with an independent editorial voice, rooted in the web technology landscape and reflecting the lived experience of web developers. We take a lead role on specific content projects within these platforms, in coordination with their core teams where appropriate.

Open Web Docs invests in and protects documentation for the open web platform. We provide incentives and a platform for other related organizations to get involved in this work. We ensure developers have the best information available to make technology and design decisions and implement on the web platform.
